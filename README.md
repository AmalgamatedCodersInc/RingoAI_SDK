# RingoAI_SDK

### Build 2025.05.09

* enhanced bright light capability to improve usability in stores (enabled by a slight change to the white screen during capture sequence, new 16 msec captures, and updated exposure blending).
* NO change to the shade-recommendation algorithms or color calculations
* edge-case bug fixes for (a) hanging after capture and before bouncing balls, (b) missing instructions during preview/alignment.
* screen brightness adjusted when SDK UX is up & app is foreground **only**
